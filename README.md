# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise ran a Kickstarter for her play Fever which came close to but did not reach it's fundraising goal. She would like to know how other Kickstarter's in the same category performed in comparison with varying launch dates and goals. We are analyzing a sample size of 4114 Kicksstarters between 2009 and 2017 which will be further narrowed down by the category of "theater".

### Purpose

Determine if the outcomes of a Kickstarter show any trends based on launch date or funding goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Out of the sample size of 4114 Kickstarter campaigns 1369 were in the category of "theater". Theater category campaigns showed a consistent trend of around 60% successful for most of the year with the exception of the summer months of May, June, July, and December. During May, June, and July the amount of successful theater campaigns spiked with May having the largest increase of 5% more successful campaigns trending downwards through June and July until reaching the trend in August. At the end of the year in December the amount of successful campaigns dropped 10% which resulted in the lowest amount of successful campaigns for based on date.

Based on this analysis theater category Kickstarter campaigns should be run in May to have the highest chance of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-Forgot to filter for theatre on outcomes based on goals sheet
-took a while to figure out checking between a range of two numbered required two criteria
-had issue matching to example line chart. Is my data different than the data used for the example? All of the formulas look good and data seems to be pulling accurately from spot checks

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
