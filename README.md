# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise ran a Kickstarter for her play Fever which came close to but did not reach it's fundraising goal. She would like to know how other Kickstarter's in the same category performed in comparison with varying launch dates and goals. We are analyzing a sample size of 4114 Kicksstarters between 2009 and 2017 which will be further narrowed down by the category of "theater".

### Purpose

Determine if the outcomes of a Kickstarter show any trends based on launch date or funding goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-Forgot to filter for theatre on outcomes based on goals sheet
-took a while to figure out checking between a range of two numbered required two criteria
-had issue matching to example line chart. Is my data different than the data used for the example? All of the formulas look good and data seems to be pulling accurately from spot checks

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
